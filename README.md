# InstaTemp
A project under exclusive copyright which is a temperature monitoring program which can be accessed using Amazon Alexa and through an android mobile app.

Mobile app hasnt been developed yet but Alexa integration is in development. Currently I'm working on getting the data that is extracted from the database to be stored into a variable. However, I need to learn more about callbacks in javascript in order to do so.
